# Bunker - NFT Marketplace that pays every member
Bunker is an NFT Marketplace that shares sales commisions and listing fees equally among all users.


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
